# A Main Heading

## A sub-heading

### A sub-sub-heading

Some normal text. Some **bold text**. Some *italic text*.

A list:

1. Item one
2. Another item
3. Item three
4. Item four, and so on
    - A sub-list item
    - Another sub-list

Lists don't have to be numbered either. Some bullet points:

- Some point
- Another point

We can use asterisks, instead, same effect:

* A bullet point
* And another one

We can insert some monospaced text, like computer code:
 `C:\Documents`. Or an entire code block:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    System.out.println("Some code block inside a Markdown file.");
}
```

Tables are even possible too, though there are slightly different
 "flavours"/syntaxes of Markdown:

| Column One | Column Two     |
|------------|----------------|
| Something  | Somethign else |
| And So on  | You see        |

One confusing feature of markdown. If you want a line of text to
 have a carriage-return/newline straight after it, then:

a) Either leave a blank line

or

b) Put **two spaces** after the end of the line.

For example  
these lines  
will all appear 
on  
separate  
lines.
